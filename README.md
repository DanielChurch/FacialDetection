<h1> Computer Vision Assigment 3 </h1>

<h2> Purpose </h2>

<p> Originally to write an app that would detect someones face in an image and let you resize the box to better fit their face & eyes.  Finally, have the face jump around the window and darken the eyes each time it bounces. (Which I tested in Python) </p>

<h3> Eye 2 Detection </h3>

<h3> Bouncing Head 1 </h3>

<h3> Bouncing Head 2 </h3>

<p> It was then changed to just face & eye detection on Android </p>

<p> From doing these assignments, I became interested in the power of OpenCV and what else I could do with it.  From there, I researched and wrote a cartoon effect. </p>
